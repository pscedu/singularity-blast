## About
Source code repository can be found [here](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+).

## Building the container for Bridges (or similar)
There is no need to build a container, because an image is already available from Biocontainers, hence all you need to do is run

```
bash ./pull.sh
```

to download the image from the repository.

To build the image from a recipe (recommend), run

```
bash ./build.sh
```

To build the image from a recipe remotely, run

```
bash ./rbuild.sh
```

## Installing the container on Bridges (or similar)
Run

```
bash ./generate_binaries.sh
```

to generate all the binaries associated with this package. Do not edit the shell scripts individually.

Copy the

* `SIF` file
* and the shell scripts generated by `generate_binaries`

to `/opt/packages/blast/2.9.0`.

## Test
To run the available tests, run the command

```
bash ./test.sh
```
